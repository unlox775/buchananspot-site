<html><body><h3>Plaintive Kildere - Aspen Hope</h3><p>A kildere spoke to me this morning,<br>'mid my mournful reverie<br>of thoughts of past, sweet times<br>when aspens blew their wistful tune.<br><p>Last night I saw the place -<br>my paradise of youth<br>where pines and aspens bent<br>on chill'd breeze.<br><p>'Mid fits and ravages<br>of mankind's swelling hunger<br>this place now fills with<br>unseemly scapes and structures.<br><p>The kildere's cries call back<br>my dispair o'er lost grace<br>and majesty of that once<br>peaceful wilderness valley.<br><p>Aspens whispering out my window<br>so long ago - of peace, still blow -<br>but who hears them? Perhaps,<br>one of Hi-Ute still can dream.<br><p>- Joseph Buchanan, 1997<br>(who lived at Hi-Ute Ranch,<br>near Park City, Utah, as a child in 1958-59)</body></html>
