The University Administration recently completed their guidelines for the sale and distribution of the new computers.<p>Beginning March 15, the University Bookstore will take orders from departments and qualifying faculty or staff. "Qualifying" faculty and staff are those who are salaried by the University at least 3/4 time. To avoid potential long lines and crowding, the Bookstore will treat applications taken through April 20 as if they all came in at the same time. A drawing will determine allocation. This ensures that applicants will be treated fairly in the event their schedules prevent them from applying on March 15.<p>While these computers are in short supply, departmental requests will receive first priority, with faculty, students and staff following in that order. The University doesn't expect nearly enough Macs to satisfy the anticipated departmental and faculty demand at this time, and therefore students will be unable to place their orders until Summer Quarter. Any regular, matriculated student enrolled and taking at least 9 hours as an undergraduate or 6 hours as a graduate student qualifies to purchase a computer. There will be a sign- up period each quarter for students meeting the above requirements.<p>Departmental orders will not require a deposit. Individuals are required to deposit $200 at the time they order. Refund requests will be honored only in the event the delivery exceeds a three-month period, otherwise the deposits are non-refundable.<p>The Macintosh computers are being made available to the University through an instructional grant from Apple. In order to protect that grant, all applicants will be required to sign a contract stipulating that they will not re-sell it for a period of two years. Individuals may purchase only one Macintosh.<p>The Macintosh package includes a display (CRT), a CPU with 128K memory, a mouse (the hand-held device that controls the cursor), a keyboard and a single-disk drive. In addition, the kit includes an operating system diskette, a manual, and a guided tour of Macintosh (cassette and diskette). Software will be stocked and sold by the Bookstore as it becomes available.<p>Individuals can expect to pay $1060 for Macintosh, plus any software and an optional extended warranty. Departmental costs are $1119 per unit, which includes the extended warranty. Maintenance for individually-owned computers will be supplied by local Apple dealers. University-owned computers will be maintained by the Electrical Engineering Department, by arrangement with the Microcomputer Resource Center.<p></body></html>
