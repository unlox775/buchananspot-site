Separately-stored images are referenced by&lt;IMG&gt; (image) tags. As a Web browser downloads and assemblespage elements, graphics are inserted into Web pages at the points&lt;IMG&gt; tags appear.</P><P>IMAGE SOURCES</P><P>Images can be obtained from other's Web pages, from CD ROMclip-art collections, from scanned images, from painting, graphicsillustration, and photo-processing programs, from digitally capturedanalog video--live or taped, from digital camers, etc. Copyrightissues and other use restrictions need to be considered whenobtaining images.</P><P>IMAGE COMPRESSION</P><P>Images tend to be large relative to text. Compression is used tokeep images small and download times reasonable. Two types ofcompression for still images are supported by most Web browsers:"GIF" and "JPEG". GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and isprononced with a soft "g". "JPEG" stands for Joint PhotographicEngineering Group and is pronounced "j-peg".</P><P>GIF is limited to 256 colors. JPEG allows millions of colors. GIFfiles tend to be smaller than JPEG files for images with few colorsand cartoon-like images with abrupt color boundaries; otherwise JPEGfiles tend to be smaller. JPEG is a must for accurate rendering ofmost photographic images. GIF images do provide one clear advantageover JPEG images--their ability to have one user-selected color inthe image replaced with "transparency."</P><P>Many computers are capable of rendering only 265 colors. On suchcomputers, JPEG images with their much larger color space tend toproduce "dithered color" wherein pixels of different colors areintersperced to approximate the actual color.</P><P>Graphics programs usually save images in their own native format:Photoshop images in Photoshop format, Corel Draw images in Corel Drawformat, etc. Many such programs have the capability of saving imagesin GIF format or JPEG format or both. With GIF compression, you areoften are given options as to the number of colors to use (why use256 if 32 will do?). With JPEG compression you are required to choosethe degree of compression (higher compression gives smaller files butpoorer image quality). Both GIF and JPEG are "lossy" compressionschemes so it is advisable to keep a versions of images you mightdesire to change at a later time in their original non-compressedformats. (Technically, non-lossy JPEG compression is possible, butyou gain so little in reduced file size it is seldom used.)</P><P>In naming image files, end GIF files with ".gif" and JPEG fileswith ".jpg" so that they will be properly displayed.</P><P><B>Example: JPEG Image vs. GIF Image</B></P><P>An orginal PICT clip-art image was saved as a medium quality JPEGat the left, and as two GIF images at the right (sizes of the imagesare approx. 20K, 30K, and 10K, respectively). Notice the color"banding" in the second GIF image due to its limited number ofcolors. The background in the GIF image was assigned transparency--afeature not available with JPEG images.</P><P><IMG SRC="goat0000.jpg" WIDTH=219 HEIGHT=355 BORDER=1 ALIGN=bottom>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="goat1000.gif" WIDTH=221 HEIGHT=357 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><IMG SRC="goat2000.gif" WIDTH=219 HEIGHT=355 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></P><P>IMAGE RESOLUTION</P><P>Images to be displayed on the Web should be no higher than screenresolution (72 dpi); otherwise, download times will be greater thannecessary. You may well want to scan images at higher resolution (say300 dpi or higher) if you ever want to print them, but obtain a 72dpi "downsampled" version for the Web. Photoshop allows you to reducethe image resolution, but be careful to save a COPY so as not replacethe original image unintentionally: increasing image resolution inPhotoshop produces graininess in the image! Much flexibility in imagemanipulation can be achieved by using a screen capture utility toobtain a screen-resolution image. I use the following technique withPhotoshop:</P><OL>   <LI>Display the image (whatever its resolution) in Photoshop.</LI>      <LI>Use the Zoom-In and Zoom-Out commands (Command+plus, and   Command+minus on the Mac or Control+plus, and Control+minus on the   PC) to get the image size I want.</LI>      <LI>Use screen capture utility to capture to the clipboard just   the portion of the image I want.</LI>      <LI>Choose New from Photoshop's File menu, OK the proferred window   size and resolution (which turns out to be screen resolution   because ot the capture utility), and paste the image from the   clipboard.</LI>      <LI>Choose Save a Copy, NOT Save As from the File menu, name the   file eding it with ".jpg", choose JPEG from the Format list box,   click on Save, choose a compression level and click OK.</LI></OL><H4>&#91; <A HREF="http://www.cc.utah.edu/~wake/web_training/webpage_const/webgraphics_intro/web_colors/web_colors.html">Next</A> | <A HREF="http://www.cc.utah.edu/~wake/web_training/webpage_const/webgraphics_intro/webgraphics_intro_idx.html">Parent</A>   | <A HREF="http://www.cc.utah.edu/~wake/index.html">Home</A> &#93;</H4></BODY></HTML><!-- This document source from http://www.cc.utah.edu/~wake/web_training/webpage_const/webgraphics_intro/web_graphics.ovr/web_graphics_ovr.html -->
