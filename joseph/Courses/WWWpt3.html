Do not expect great results, you will need tospend a lot of time proof-reading and adjusting, but it can still bea good help. Sometimes it is still better to type it in yourself orget someone to type it for you.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>If your document is already on the computer in some form, thereare tools becoming available now to convert them to HTML. Some aredefinitely better than others. Many simply take the text and add thebasic HTML headers and trailers and put in paragraph separations.Some good products come from Word Perfect, Microsoft (InternetAssistant) and Claris (Homepage). There is also Adobe Pagemill andsimilar products. A shareware program, BB-Edit also supportsconverting documents.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE=5>Graphics</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>The best types of graphics to work with on the Web are GIF andJPEG. These are actually graphics compression methods. Generally,pictures are created in some original method and then converted,compressing them into smaller storage, the size varying on quality ofthe image. In addition to size compression, GIF also has options fortransparency and interlacing. Usually, when viewed on the computerscreen, the quality degradation resulting from compression is notgreatly visible. The quality is usually acceptable and the storagespace savings is considerable. It is often the case that an originalimage of high resolution and quality can be 4 or 5 megabytes orlarger and when compressed is less than 100K.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Adobe Photoshop is a good program for taking pictures of variouskinds and converting to GIF or JPEG. Generally, photos and pictureswith great varieties of color or gray shading work better as JPEGsand sketches or line drawings as GIFs, but either kind works OK.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>JPEG compression of medium quality is usually sufficient for Webuse.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Other tools are available. For simple (free) use on a Macintosh,you can use the Simple Text program to view PICTs (the commonMacintosh graphics format) and then cut out rectangular pieces forplacing in documents. If you do not have Photoshop, you can useprograms such as Clip2Gif to convert files or clipboards (Macintoshstorage for cutting and pasting). Also note that you can take asnapshot of the Macintosh screen with the key combinationcommand(apple)-shift-3. This picture can be viewed with SimpleText.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Notes on embedding graphics in HTML files:</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>The size of graphics images are measured in Pixels (or screendots). Note that the width of Netscape screens vary around 500 pixelswide or so. If you open a GIF or JPEG directly in Netscape (not as anembedded image in a HTML page), it should show the size of thepicture, in Pixels, at the top of the window in the window titlearea.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Images embedded in HTML can be specified either with or withoutheight or width parameters. If the height and width are notspecified, the actual size will be used. Any specified dimensionswill be used to display a graphic and if the dimensions are notproportional to the real size, some shrinking or stretching will takeplace and the image will not look correct.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Useful Note: If the dimensions are specified on all images in aHTML page, regardless of whether they are the actual dimensions, thenthe HTML page will be displayed more quickly by Netscape, because thepage layout can be calculated before the images are downloaded. Inthis case, the text of the page appears with blank areas showingwhere the pictures will eventually appear.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>If you store your GIF images in Interlace format, they will beginto appear as they download, in a blurry form, but will eventuallyresolve into their final form. Also note that transparent GIFs can beshown over other things.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE=5>Sound and Video</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Sound can be inputted into a Macintosh using the microphone thatcomes with it, using the sound control panel. This is saved as a"beep" sound. A good program for inputting sounds and saving them invarious formats is Sound Machine. There are several sound types usedon the Internet. One of the most common types is AU.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>For video, you will need a way of capturing video into yourcomputer and then the software to process it. The AV capablecomputers can receive video images. Adobe Premiere and Avid Videoshopare programs that can process the images. The storage types for theWeb are usually MPEG or Quicktime (MOOV). A helper application formovies is Sparkle, also Movie Player for quicktime movies. Netscape3.0 will support Quicktime movies directly (Mac or PC).</P></BODY></HTML>
