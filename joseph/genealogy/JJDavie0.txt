Historical Sketch of My Life.  John Johnson Davies(Original text with no corrections - transcribed by Joseph F. Buchanan, joseph@cc.utah.edu) - Transcription notes: For the letters C, M, S and T, it is difficult to distinguish between capitals and lower case letters. Words beginning with E almost always have the E capitalized. There are many dots throughout that appear to be periods, but could probably be commas in many cases. In the poetry, the verse numbering always appears in the left margin, with no spacing between the verses. I added the spacing to show the numbering.)I am a verry Poor Spellerand also verry poor writerI know but little about gramerthen please to Excuse all my blundersI was born on the 28 of december 1831, in the city of Carmarthen, Carmarthen Sher South Wales.

The first place i come to on my jurney was the city of llanellhe. This was twenty miles from home. i felt a little homesick here. because i did not get work here. i stayed with my Aunt a few days in this city. i felt quite lonesom here. Why. because i was amongest strangers and verry young and had but little Experience in the world. the nex place i come to was Caslocher. i was lucky this time. i got work with a man Named David Thomas. i work for him three months. and made good Wages. i whent to meeting with him Sunday he was the leader of the choir. of the Baptist Church. he introdused me to the singers. and I join them in their singing. i made many friends in this place. i left this place feeling good. because i had some money now to go on with I started again. in a rain storm. i traveled a few miles and got to Swanze city Glanmorgan Sher.

The nex day i started to work. he Watched me verry close. but he soon found out that i understood my bisness. and he also introdused me to the choir of his church. and I took part with them. I done well in this place. Now i was geting home sick. I bought a sute of chothes and started for home. i got home on the 21st of december 1850. i can tell you that i felt like the Poet says, there's no place like home and that is true. when i got home. My old friends came to see me and we had a good chat together. and also singing. and that Evening i went to see the girl i cept company with befor i left home. and She wellcom me home. and truly i felt at home in her comepany. her Name was Mariah I started to work again. to a man by the Name of David Edwards. The loom that I got to work in was nex to the door. and i caught a verry bad cold. and i was taken verry sick with the chills and fever. i was sick for a long time i had a chill everry day for many days, then one every other day, yes for three months. Then they quite and in a few days I felt midling well. Then Mother tould me to go to llanstuffan a vilage by the sea shore. for to regain my strength. i went to this place in a boat down the river fifteen miles i enjoyed myself verry good awhile. and got healthy and strong. i was here for two weeks but to my sorrow i was taken sick again. i started out one day. from the vilage. and whent as far as the old Castles. that was bilt by the Welsh people. hundreds of years ago. and when i got there. i sat on a log. This castle was bilt on a high cliff close to the sea shore. and while looking at the tide a comeing in. and the ships out on sea. i felt a quier feeling come over me. and i said. is it posible that i am going to have the chills again. i did not stop there. but a few minutes. before i was on the way to the vilage. a mile away. i was geting sicker all the time. when i got to the vilage. i took a drink of brandy. then i felt a litter better. nex morning i had a heavy chill. i paid for my board and started back home with the Evening tide. i got home on the 24. of June 1851. and when i got in the house. my Mother looked at me. and said. what is the mater John. i am sick with the chills again. She said never mind. you will get over it. She done all in her power to help me. I was again sick untill the middle of September. and after i got over the chills this time my Brothers tould me to go to school. that they would pay for the school bill. i was in school one quarter. and this is all the schooling that done me Enny good to me in my days.In the month of August 1851. the Father and Mother of the girl that i kept company with was rebaptized into the Church of latter day Saints.

The nex day was Sunday. we whent to meeting and we was confirmed by the Elders. nex Sunday the 18. i whent to meeting. and i was ordained a priest in this meeting. and was sent out with two of the Elders to bear testimony to the people. I traveled a good deel with the Elders to help them with the singing. and to bear testimony. i know that the preaching and singing of the latter day saints. as an influence. that the world dont have. i know that this is true. my girl and myself used to go on Excursion to the sea shore in a steamer and sometimes in a boat to the sea shore. England and Wales was a great country for Enjoyments when i was ther. Excuse me for saying so much about my girl. i cant help it. for she was a good company to me.I Was Made GladIt was in Wales my Native landthat i obeyed. the Lord's commandAnd when i heard. the Elders preachI knew twas truth that they did teach2I was glad in the days of my youthto here the principles of truthThe same truths. the Savior unfouldto the jews and the Nations of old3And when i first heard them proclaimThat the gospel. of truth once againhas come to the Earth to restorethe gifts of the gospel once more4No says the priest. we know the wayAnd we shall not. lead you astraybut will show you. the right roadAnd also. the ways of the Lord5I know that they have gon astrayAnd they will not retres their wayI know that they. have not the planto teach and save. poor fallen man6That was a great and glorious dayWhen Joseph Smith the unlearned boyReveled the plan. to save all menThen let us praise the Lord Amen,        J. J. DaviesNow I will write a few words aboute the weding. it was on the 3. of october 1853. that i got married to Mariah Davies the daughter of Henry and Martha Davies.

There was a few of the prominent Elders invited to the weding and we had a pleasent time. we had song, speache Resitation tosts. and poetry composed for the occasion by the Elders of the latter day Saints. i stayed in Wales a few months after the weding. Now comes the sorrowfull time for us to leve our friends and relations. behend us in our Native land. we prepared Every thing that we could think of for the jurny.My Early daysI offten think of my youthfull daysWhen romeing through the streets of WalesWith my comrads that was full of gleeAnd verry seldom we disagree2Those days whent fast the years rouled onuntill i was nearly twenty oneThen i thought it was time for metoo stop my romeing and fooish glee3So i turn my thoughts to greater worthAnd then i found. the precious truthThen i obayed. the laws of heavenThe plan our Savior. to us given4And now my friends. i have something newThe truth of which.

My Father and Mother in law and myself and wife. Started to the valleys of the mountains on the 4. Feb. in the ship Colcondah a sailing vessel. There were 464 Saints on board. The ship was taken out to the oppen sea by A Steamer. and then we was left on sea to the mercy of God. There was one thing that gave us joy and satisfaction. we knew. that God was with us to protect us on the sea. we had a good captain to gide the ship. and in a short time. after the steamer left us. the ship was in full sail. and she looked handsom. we had a good breze and she ploughed the main verry fast. it was verry cold when we left Laverpool. and in a few days. we got to a warmmer climet. and we was comfortable on deck. it was a site to us to see ships a sailing on the sea. we had a brass band on board i was one of them. all of us was Walesh boys. also was a choir. and i was one of them also a string band. They played for dancies. we had dancies on sea. There was a few Elders on board returning from their mission. we had a few batchalors on board. they having a place by themselves. They called it Batchlors hall. They made lots of fun to us on sea. The captain was verry kind to us Espeshily to the sick. but verry little sickness we had on sea. and only one death. and that was an infant. and indeed. it was a sollum time when the child was droped into the sea. we Enjoyed our selves verry good. while traveling on the sea. our president was Elder Curtis. he was returning from his mission. we had meetings every Sunday. Brother Curtis organized us. and apointed teachers to look after us we had a good voiage and had but one storm. it was a fearfull one. and i shall never forget it. it lasted aboute 4 hours. i was on deck to see it all the waves look to be as big as mountains. The sailors got all the sails fasten before the storm was verry bad. The thunder and lightling was terable and the rain a pouring down. but the ship done well. but she sprung a leek. but it was soon stopt. The storm quite aboute dark. The nex day the ship was in full sail again. and we all felt to rejoice for fine wheather once more. and i can tell you my friends. that we felt to rejoiceI Will Never ForgetI shall never. forget that dayThe time for me. to go awayAnd leve my Mother and Brother threeto go a cross the mighty sea2Twas in the morning at Eight oclockThe ship Colcondah. left the dockThen the captain. gave his commandAnd took us safe. to zion's land3And when we first. stopt on the landIt did look good. and also grandWe felt to say. with one acordYes thanks yes thank.s be to the Lord.        DaviesWe had the pleasure to see a weding on sea. The brid was tide to a chair and hoisted up quite a ways up the riggings of the ship. The Captain said. what a brave woman. Then she took her hancerchief and waved it in the breze. The bridsman was caried around the ship in a chair. by four Batchilors. They made it for that purpose. This took place aboute the first of March 1854 we had a great deel of amusment on sea. and when we got through the gulf of Mexico. the captain said. ship aboute. then we traveled North East. untill we got to that great river Mississppi here a steamer came to meet us. and towed us up that mighty river. The watter was verry mudy. and when we came to the quarantine station. we had to stop here. for the dockters to Examin us. and when the dockters came on board. we passed them two by two. They pronoused us all well. we started again. and got to New Orleans on the 18. of March 1854. we made the trip in six weeks from Laverpool to this place. we stayed in New orleans a few days to get ready to travel up the rever again. it is aboute one hundred miles from the mouth of the Mississippi to New Orleans. and we were glad to get there. and Aboute the last of March. we started for St. Louse. in a small steam Boat. yes indeed. we was crouded in that little boatWe Was CrowdedNow we are traveling up the reverCrouded in that little steamerBut still we felt to ask the Lordfor to protect us all on board,           the old man DaviesNow we are going. yes faster and fasterThe steam boat a puffing. and snorting and pushinghar against the stream. but oh. what a durty watter for us to usewe dip it up for the settle it. but it does net get much betterNever mind. we will do the best we can with itI must drink it. Ennyhow. because i am verry thurstyAnd what a rackity noyes. it maks me shudderThe captain a shouting. and the watter a splashingAnd the band a playing. and some of us a singingAnd some of the sisters. a washing and the babes a cryingAnd the sailors a talking. and some of them a smokingAnd all of us trying to do somethingAnd the boat a tugging and snortingWhen traveling up the Missouri also the Mississppi. i will say that it was a great site to us. to see such forest of timber and land And what a wonderfull stream this is going in such a force. taking down some verry larg logs. They some times strik the boat. with a tremendous blows. but we got through all right all the same. we got to St. Louis aboute the 10. of April 1854. and we was glad to get there. but what a durty looking place this is to be shure. and when we got on shore. we had a great and a sad site. to see the Negros working. rouling the cotton bails the boss that was looking after them. used them verry ruff. Sometimes he would give them. a hard lick withe the whip he had. i thought that was bad to treet human beings. in that way. and here we are. crouded into an old ospetal it is the best place we can get. we stayed two weeks in St. Louis. here the cholera started among us. and we buried. a few of the Brethren and Sisters in this place. and in a few days the word was to get ready to start up the river again. and we was glad of the chance. The disdants from New orleans to St. Louis. is aboute twelve hundred miles. and we bid that place good by. and we wasent sorry of itThe Gospel PlanAnd God in his mercy. to this genirationBeveled to the Prophet. the plan of salvationThe verry same plan. the apostels of oldWas sent by the Savior to preach to the world2When Jesus our Savior. was here among menhe taught the great plan. of the gospel to themAnd tould his disciples. go forth and proclaimthrough faith and baptism. salvation will come3And also he said. lay your hands upon themthat they may receve. the promes that's givenFor the spirit of God. will show them the way4And also will gide them. from going astrayThere's twelve apostles to be in the churchYes. prophets and teachers. to gide and to teachAnd all these officers. and many more5Was all in the church. in the days of yoreBut all of the preist. will say we dond needThe gifts of the gospel. for they have all ceased6And this is the docktrine. they've tought unto menBut the Saints dont beleve. such docktrin as themThe latter day Saints. will not go astrayif they will be faithfull. and also to prayThen let the Saints. rejoice and to singFor Jesus our Savior. shall be our King,                          J. J. DaviesNow for another start again. we started from St. Louis. on the 24. of April 1854. and after we got started. the captain of the boat said put on more steam. and away she gose. we had a good view of the country. on both sides of the revers. it was a great site to us. because most all of us was treads men. from the work shop. and that is the resen. that so much traveling through this country. was interested to us. we had to stop a few times to bury the dead while going up the rever. we got to Kansas Missouri. in the month of may. the distants from St. Louis to Kanas is aboute 4. hundred miles. This was a trading post in them days. one or two stores. and a few houses. and after we got on shore. we camped close to the river. The cholera was verry bad amongest us by this time. and in a few days we maved from here to Wm Magee's plantation. now we had a good place to camp in. we buried quite a few of our Brethren and Sisters in this place. it was here i buried my Father and Mother in law. we styed in these camps six weeks. we went from here to west port. and stayed here a few days. to get ready to start on the plains. now comes the labor and toil for a people. that has no Experience whatever. yes. more then a thou-sand miles across this great plains. and also those great mountains before we would get to the valleys of the mountains. oh yes. we had a fine time to see the Negros. breaking the young stears. for the companyTraveling together to the west, my self and wifeWe've traveled together in peace many yearsYes. over the Sea and also great riversAnd on our journey. thus far we are blessedAnd God in His mercy our lives has preservedThe Cholera at KansasAnd that aughfull disease. which all of us dreadWas raging in camp. and many of us diedIt was here i buried. my Father and MotherAnd truly twas aughfull. to leve them both here2And those sorrowfull days. were terable badBut the saints. had faith in the promes of GodThen we faithfully ask. for the plage to ceaseAnd God in His mercy. then stopt the diseaseStarting on the PlainsThe first night we camped. was on the Indian CreekAnd my wife that verry night. was taken sickAnd before the ninght was overThe wife gave birth to a daughter,                    the old man DaviesNow For a hard tripWe started on the plains on the first of July, 1854.We traveled along the best we knew how. for many a day. Now i will releat a few things that happaen to us on the plains. betwen west port and Larime. the first night we camped. it was at Indian Creek. and between twelve and one oclock in the night my wife gave birth to a daughter in a tent. and at Eight oclock in the morning, we rouled out again. we traveled 25. miles and camped for the night. Now i will tell you aboute the sircuse. that we had the first few days on the plains. our captain tould us in the Evening. to get up Early in the morning. for to get redy to start in good time after breakfast was over. we got the cattle together. and tryed to yoked them up. i can assure you that this was quite a task for us. and after we got them itched to the wagon. we started out. now comes the sircuse. and it was a good one. The Captain was a waching us. and telling us what to do. he tould us to take a whip and use it. and say woo ah duke. gee brandy. and so on Now the fun commenced then we whent after them prety lively. and when the cattle went gee too much we would run to the off side. and yelling at them woo ah. and bunting them with the whip stock. Then they would go to much ha and we was puffing and sweeting. and if you was there to look on. you would say that it was a great sircuse. This was a great Experience and a tuff one. and by the time we got half way across the plains we could drive an ox teame as well as you can Enny day. There was ten persons to Every wagon. There was 6  men in my wagon. three of them left me at Fort Kearney. and two sick in the wagon. and one died on the road. we buried him Nex morning. i had to drive the teame alone all the way to the valleys I had a big red boil under my right arm. which gave me great pain. we had plenty of grass and watter. but verry little wood on the plains. The wemen gathered Buffolose chips to make a fier to cook by. to give us something to eat. we traveled a few days more a got to ash hollow which Which is 150 miles from Fort Kearney. and Fort Kearney is betwen 2 or 3 hundred miles from Missouri River. when we was on the ash hollow hill. the wagon wheel whent over a boy's head, and came very near loseing his life. The Elders administred to him and he got better. his name is Johnathan Prothro. we had to lock both wheels to go down this hill we camped for the night on the botom of the platte river. nex morning we was off again. and after i got out aways from this place. the wagon wheel went over my foot. i took some oil and anointed my foot. and in a short time, it was all right.In Memory of our driveingIndeed we had. a verry tuff timesThe first few days. we drove our teamsThe Captain. he would laugh. sometimesat us driveing. yes on the plains,                JohnIn camp after supper. we would sing and chat. at nine oclock we had prayers. then we'd go to rest. There was fifty wagons in the train. we had besids the Captain of the trine. five more were chosen. one for ever ten wagons to tell us what we had to do. one day when traveling on the road. we had a stamped the teams started out on the run and they tangled up fast together. it was a Wonder that no one was kild and nothing brock. Then we parted them and Itch them up again. and traveled a few miles and camped for the night. we had a nother one. but this one was in the night. while they was in the corrall the captain was a fraid of Indians that night. we made a corrall with the Wagons Every Evening. The cattle that night bunted the wagons pretty lively and the captain shouted to the gard to let them go. and they went out on the run. nex morning afater breakfast we got them together some was 15 miles away. We traveled a few miles that day. nex morning we rouled out again. when looking towards the west we could see the Chimney rock. we thought we would get to it that day. but it took us 2 or 3 days. indeed it dose look like a chimney. My wife had a gathered brest. She was sick for a long time. i got the Elders to administered to her and she receved the blessing. and got well. The buffolose on the plains in them days by the tens of thounsands the boys wounded a young bull. and he came a snorting and crossed the road betwen the wagons. but the boys down him and fetched one quarter to camp. now i will write a few words that I read in McCarlton's book, The Wonderland of the wild west. which is verry appropriate rite here. The untraveled tourist will feast his vision on those vast prairis or plains. day after day untill we reach the foot hills of the rocky mountains We passed over these illimitable plains untill the brain reels and the Eye is tired of looking upon the vast Expanse.The Great PlainsAnd what a wonderfull countryIs this great western prairie.Where Indians and buffolose romesWithout fear. all over the plains.           J.J.D.The night before we came to Lariime. we camped a few miles from the Fort This Fort is located on the south side of the North Platt at the foot of the Black hills. it being 550 miles west of the Missouri River. in the morning we rouled out towards the Fort. and in a short time after we started. we passed a larg camp of Suix Indians. we passed the fort and camped by the platte river for noon. the danish train that was behind us came along the same day the Indians kild one of their cows. The danish captain. tould the millitary captain aboute it. then the captain of the Fort send some of this men to see the Indians aboute it. and they got to a disbuite. and the soldiers fired at them. The Indains kild some of the soldiers and burnt the Fort the danish captain came along to our camp and said. that the Indains was on the war path the trappers also was comeing towards us for dear life. we all crossed the River all right. we had a larg camp. that night. and we thought we would haft to fight. but the Indains had their reveng. we camped together for A few nights. then we sapperated. i beleved that the Lord over ruled it for our good we did not see Enny more Indains untili we came to Salt Lake CityThe Glorious PlanAnd when i think. of the gloriouse planGod had reveled. unto fallen manIt gives me joy within my mindto think that God. had been so kind2And the gospel. plan. will save the worldif they will obey. the laws of GodAnd also them. that's now in prisenfor they must here the laws of heaven3our Savior whent there to unlock the dooralso did preach. to them that was thereJoseph and Brigham. and Heber as wellThey have gon there. the glad tidings to tell4And our ancesters. and friends are therelooking to us. their way to prepareThen let us go. and work for the deadThis we can do. in the temples of God5And this will be. yes a glorious timeWhen friends and relations. will meet againAnd when they do meet. how happy they'll beIn peace and love. through all Eternity,                          J. J. Davies Now we are in the black hills and in a few days travel. we got to the red bute we jog along again. and got to the willow Spring. and the nex place was the Cayote Spring. and from here to the Independant rock is ten miles. here we struk the Sweet watter. The nex place was the davel's gate. The nex place was the rocky ridge. This ridge his the back bone of the Rocky Mountains. The streams runs from here in all dirictions. here where the South pass is. we are still a going yes up and down through the hills. untill we reach. little Sandy. and nex place was the big Sandy. right here where Lot Smith burnt the wagons with supplies for that great American army. lead by General Johnson. They was sent by the goverment. to punish the latter day Saints. for something that was not true. Six miles further west we struk the green river. The nex place we come to was Fort Bridger. and in this old Fort that Army spent the winter of 1857. And they stayed there becaus they was oblidged too. The distants from this Fort to Salt Lake City. is one hundred and 13 miles. we bid good by to the Fort. and traveled along the best we could. untill we got through the Emmegration Canyon. then we could see the valles of the mountains. which made us to rejoice and to thank the Lord for his blessing to us on the journny. we got to the city of the saints a few days after the october conference of 1854. we rould through the city with joyfull hearts and camped on the Emmegration square west of the temple block. we all felt to rejoice can you blame us for haveing a joyfull hearts. No. i do not think that you would. i know if you had to travel such a journny you would feel to rejoice and to thank the Lord. for the blessings that you did receve on such journey. for i can say that the Lord. did bless us on that great journny.In Memory of the JournnyAnd when we left. our Native landto go west. to the promise landWe felt so bad. to leve behindthe dearest friends. that was so kind.2I know that we. was glad to seeThe watters. of the inland seaAnd the great city. of the westwhere the pilgrims shall have a rest.       John J. Davies.My wife's cusen Elizabeth and her husband Rees J. Williams came to see us in camp and we had a good chat together. he said to us. i want you to come and stay awhile with us. we stayed with them untill Christmas time was over after i rested a few days i started to work on the new road from the City West to the jordan bridge. after this job was done i worked on the public works. I help to bild the Endowment house and also on the foundation of that great temple and when i was working here i had a terable blow. one of the larg blocks of rock slipt down to the foundation and struck one of the levers and it came in such a force and struck me on the side of my head senceless to the ground. the brethren adminstered to me and i got better. The superintendent of the work was Brother Daniel H. Wells. Now i will say a word aboute the fight. it was in the winter of 1854 on Christmas morning between the mormon boys and collonel Steptoa's soldiers. I was rite there at the time. it was geting quite ruff before they quit. President Young sent Brother Orsen Hide to stop it and it was lucky that it was stopt becaus it was getting quite ruff. the boys done as they was tould and peace was restored. the work on the public works stopt at Christmas time. Then i work at my trade to Sister McKeny in the Elaventh ward i work for her untili April Conference in 1855 Sister McKeny and my self and wife whent to meeting held in the Tabenacle on Sunday in a carage. This was a great honor to us. i wove that winter five hundred yards of carpet for the use of the Tabernacle and after the April Conference was over i went to North Ogden to live. The first Sunday I was here the Bishop, Brother Thomas Dun, set me apart to lead the singing and to organized a singing class. So I did. and before i left North Ogden we had a good choir. now I will say a few words aboute the grass hoper war. They distroyed Nearly all the crops in the Northern Settlements and bread stuff wa verry sceres many had to dig roots to sustain life. i had to do that myself. i went to the field to Watter my corn one day i got verry week and started for home and when i got to the door of the house i met my little daughter Martha and she ask for some bread and butter, and there was no bread in the house. This was a trying time, you bet. i took a sack and started out and said, i will have some flower before i'll come back. i went to mother Marler. all she had in the house was twenty pounds of flower and one lofe of bread. She gave me half of what she had in the house and when i got home my wife smiled. Then we had a good breakfast.

The prophet of God said that the Lord Excepted the sacrifice of the people and he said that the Lord would bless them for it. and I can bear my testimony that the Lord did bless us just as he said I never forget seeing women and children as well as men who were destitute of teams pulling handcarts through the storm of snow. indeed it was a sublime Exhibition. of faith of the latter day Saints. and when traveling south the time of the move the people had teams and wagons of all disgription the best team to my fancy. was three yoks of yearling. indeed they did look prety. I whent as far as Spanish Fork and stayed here one year. and went back to my home in the North in the fall of 1859. we as a people was blessed after the move, allthough it was a great sacrifice for usTheir Just DueSome people they think they know it allAnd others, they'll say knows nothing atallBut this is not right for me and for youThen let us givee all what is their just due.2And here i will say to you and to meyes. let us be kind to all that we seeAnd also be true. and do what is bestWhen we'll be happy and we shall be blest.
