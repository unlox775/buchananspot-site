She never resigned herself to him going so far away. Her sorrow was made greater as he died soon after seeing his family settled, without seeing Martha again. However, her heart was cheered by frequent visits from Joseph's widow, Ellen, and her children, who were very sympathetic and understanding. They would sit and cry together, talking over past experiences through their great love for each other. Ed, one of Ellen's sons, spoke tenderly at Martha's funeral.<p>Martha gave birth to nine children, five girls and four boys: Peter Edwin, John Lee, twin girls who died as babies, Martha Ellen and Ann Elizabeth, Sylvia Alice, Agnes Eleanor, Sarah Delilah, George Hyrum and Joseph Elmer; whom are all a credit to a wonderful mother. Her life was not a social one, nor did she seek public positions. She believed in simplicity and never sought fame. Her whole life was spent in doing good for others, the latter part in administering to her own family.<p>She took great pride in rearing her large family and giving good council and being an example to them. She was happy when they were doing well and prospering to make good homes and living righteous lives, and was grieved when problems and sorrows came. She was gifted with true motherhood. Her love was divine, simple and beautiful.<p>In tribute to Martha Ann Lovell Anderson, my mother, I write this brief history with gratitude in my heart, for she gave birth to me, her youngest child out of the goodness of her noble heart, and the blessing of our Heavenly Father, granted her because of her faith and prayers, when she was in ill health, having just lost a child, and ordinarily beyond the age of child bearing. This story she told me when a young man, causing a burning appreciation in my soul for life and being blessed to be born through the lineage of such a noble mother. In the words of Abraham Lincoln, "All that I am, and all I may become, I owe to my Angel Mother." Bless her memory.<p>                            - Joseph E.
