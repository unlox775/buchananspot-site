Words beginning with E almost always have the E capitalized. There are many dots throughout that appear to be periods, but could probably be commas in many cases. In the poetry, the verse numbering always appears in the left margin, with no spacing between the verses. I added the spacing to show the numbering. - Joseph Buchanan, 8 Oct. 1996]<p><hr>I am a verry Poor Speller<br>and also verry poor writer<br>I know but little about gramer<br>then please to Excuse all my blunders<p>I was born on the 28 of december 1831, in the city of Carmarthen, Carmarthen Sher South Wales.

My Father and Mother in law and myself and wife. Started to the valleys of the mountains on the 4. Feb. in the ship Colcondah a sailing vessel. There were 464 Saints on board. The ship was taken out to the oppen sea by A Steamer. and then we was left on sea to the mercy of God. There was one thing that gave us joy and satisfaction. we knew. that God was with us to protect us on the sea. we had a good captain to gide the ship. and in a short time. after the steamer left us. the ship was in full sail. and she looked handsom. we had a good breze and she ploughed the main verry fast. it was verry cold when we left Laverpool. and in a few days. we got to a warmmer climet. and we was comfortable on deck. it was a site to us to see ships a sailing on the sea. we had a brass band on board i was one of them. all of us was Walesh boys. also was a choir. and i was one of them also a string band. They played for dancies. we had dancies on sea. There was a few Elders on board returning from their mission. we had a few batchalors on board. they having a place by themselves. They called it Batchlors hall. They made lots of fun to us on sea. The captain was verry kind to us Espeshily to the sick. but verry little sickness we had on sea. and only one death. and that was an infant. and indeed. it was a sollum time when the child was droped into the sea. we Enjoyed our selves verry good. while traveling on the sea. our president was Elder Curtis. he was returning from his mission. we had meetings every Sunday. Brother Curtis organized us. and apointed teachers to look after us we had a good voiage and had but one storm. it was a fearfull one. and i shall never forget it. it lasted aboute 4 hours. i was on deck to see it all the waves look to be as big as mountains. The sailors got all the sails fasten before the storm was verry bad. The thunder and lightling was terable and the rain a pouring down. but the ship done well. but she sprung a leek. but it was soon stopt. The storm quite aboute dark. The nex day the ship was in full sail again. and we all felt to rejoice for fine wheather once more. and i can tell you my friends. that we felt to rejoice<p>I Will Never Forget<p>I shall never. forget that day<br>The time for me. to go away<br>And leve my Mother and Brother three<br>to go a cross the mighty sea<p>2<br>Twas in the morning at Eight oclock<br>The ship Colcondah. left the dock<br>Then the captain. gave his command<br>And took us safe. to zion's land<p>3<br>And when we first. stopt on the land<br>It did look good. and also grand<br>We felt to say. with one acord<br>Yes thanks yes thank.s be to the Lord.        Davies<p>We had the pleasure to see a weding on sea. The brid was tide to a chair and hoisted up quite a ways up the riggings of the ship. The Captain said. what a brave woman. Then she took her hancerchief and waved it in the breze. The bridsman was caried around the ship in a chair. by four Batchilors. They made it for that purpose. This took place aboute the first of March 1854 we had a great deel of amusment on sea. and when we got through the gulf of Mexico. the captain said. ship aboute. then we traveled North East. untill we got to that great river Mississppi here a steamer came to meet us. and towed us up that mighty river. The watter was verry mudy. and when we came to the quarantine station. we had to stop here. for the dockters to Examin us. and when the dockters came on board. we passed them two by two. They pronoused us all well. we started again. and got to New Orleans on the 18. of March 1854. we made the trip in six weeks from Laverpool to this place. we stayed in New orleans a few days to get ready to travel up the rever again. it is aboute one hundred miles from the mouth of the Mississippi to New Orleans. and we were glad to get there. and Aboute the last of March. we started for St. Louse. in a small steam Boat. yes indeed. we was crouded in that little boat<p>We Was Crowded<p>Now we are traveling up the rever<br>Crouded in that little steamer<br>But still we felt to ask the Lord<br>for to protect us all on board,           the old man Davies<p>Now we are going. yes faster and faster<br>The steam boat a puffing. and snorting and pushing<br>har against the stream. but oh. what a durty watter for us to use<br>we dip it up for the settle it. but it does net get much better<br>Never mind. we will do the best we can with it<br>I must drink it. Ennyhow. because i am verry thursty<br>And what a rackity noyes. it maks me shudder<br>The captain a shouting. and the watter a splashing<br>And the band a playing. and some of us a singing<br>And some of the sisters. a washing and the babes a crying<br>And the sailors a talking. and some of them a smoking<br>And all of us trying to do something<br>And the boat a tugging and snorting<p>When traveling up the Missouri also the Mississppi. i will say that it was a great site to us. to see such forest of timber and land And what a wonderfull stream this is going in such a force. taking down some verry larg logs. They some times strik the boat. with a tremendous blows. but we got through all right all the same. we got to St. Louis aboute the 10. of April 1854. and we was glad to get there. but what a durty looking place this is to be shure. and when we got on shore. we had a great and a sad site. to see the Negros working. rouling the cotton bails the boss that was looking after them. used them verry ruff. Sometimes he would give them. a hard lick withe the whip he had. i thought that was bad to treet human beings. in that way. and here we are. crouded into an old ospetal it is the best place we can get. we stayed two weeks in St. Louis. here the cholera started among us. and we buried. a few of the Brethren and Sisters in this place. and in a few days the word was to get ready to start up the river again. and we was glad of the chance. The disdants from New orleans to St. Louis. is aboute twelve hundred miles. and we bid that place good by. and we wasent sorry of it<p>The Gospel Plan<p>And God in his mercy. to this geniration<br>Beveled to the Prophet. the plan of salvation<br>The verry same plan. the apostels of old<br>Was sent by the Savior to preach to the world<p>2<br>When Jesus our Savior. was here among men<br>he taught the great plan. of the gospel to them<br>And tould his disciples. go forth and proclaim<br>through faith and baptism. salvation will come<p>3<br>And also he said. lay your hands upon them<br>that they may receve. the promes that's given<br>For the spirit of God. will show them the way<p>4<br>And also will gide them. from going astray<br>There's twelve apostles to be in the church<br>Yes. prophets and teachers. to gide and to teach<br>And all these officers. and many more<p>5<br>Was all in the church. in the days of yore<br>But all of the preist. will say we dond need<br>The gifts of the gospel. for they have all ceased<p>6<br>And this is the docktrine. they've tought unto men<br>But the Saints dont beleve. such docktrin as them<br>The latter day Saints. will not go astray<br>if they will be faithfull. and also to pray<br>Then let the Saints. rejoice and to sing<br>For Jesus our Savior. shall be our King,                          J. J. Davies<p>Now for another start again. we started from St. Louis. on the 24. of April 1854. and after we got started. the captain of the boat said put on more steam. and away she gose. we had a good view of the country. on both sides of the revers. it was a great site to us. because most all of us was treads men. from the work shop. and that is the resen. that so much traveling through this country. was interested to us. we had to stop a few times to bury the dead while going up the rever. we got to Kansas Missouri. in the month of may. the distants from St. Louis to Kanas is aboute 4. hundred miles. This was a trading post in them days. one or two stores. and a few houses. and after we got on shore. we camped close to the river. The cholera was verry bad amongest us by this time. and in a few days we maved from here to Wm Magee's plantation. now we had a good place to camp in. we buried quite a few of our Brethren and Sisters in this place. it was here i buried my Father and Mother in law. we styed in these camps six weeks. we went from here to west port. and stayed here a few days. to get ready to start on the plains. now comes the labor and toil for a people. that has no Experience whatever. yes. more then a thou-sand miles across this great plains. and also those great mountains before we would get to the valleys of the mountains. oh yes. we had a fine time to see the Negros. breaking the young stears. for the company<p>Traveling together to the west, my self and wife<p>We've traveled together in peace many years<br>Yes. over the Sea and also great rivers<br>And on our journey. thus far we are blessed<br>And God in His mercy our lives has preserved<p>The Cholera at Kansas<p>And that aughfull disease. which all of us dread<br>Was raging in camp. and many of us died<br>It was here i buried. my Father and Mother<br>And truly twas aughfull. to leve them both here<p>2<br>And those sorrowfull days. were terable bad<br>But the saints. had faith in the promes of God<br>Then we faithfully ask. for the plage to cease<br>And God in His mercy. then stopt the disease<p>Starting on the Plains<p>The first night we camped. was on the Indian Creek<br>And my wife that verry night. was taken sick<br>And before the ninght was over<br>The wife gave birth to a daughter,                    the old man Davies<p>Now For a hard trip<p>We started on the plains on the first of July, 1854.<br>We traveled along the best we knew how. for many a day. Now i will releat a few things that happaen to us on the plains. betwen west port and Larime. the first night we camped. it was at Indian Creek. and between twelve and one oclock in the night my wife gave birth to a daughter in a tent. and at Eight oclock in the morning, we rouled out again. we traveled 25. miles and camped for the night. Now i will tell you aboute the sircuse. that we had the first few days on the plains. our captain tould us in the Evening. to get up Early in the morning. for to get redy to start in good time after breakfast was over. we got the cattle together. and tryed to yoked them up. i can assure you that this was quite a task for us. and after we got them itched to the wagon. we started out. now comes the sircuse. and it was a good one. The Captain was a waching us. and telling us what to do. he tould us to take a whip and use it. and say woo ah duke. gee brandy. and so on Now the fun commenced then we whent after them prety lively. and when the cattle went gee too much we would run to the off side. and yelling at them woo ah. and bunting them with the whip stock. Then they would go to much ha and we was puffing and sweeting. and if you was there to look on. you would say that it was a great sircuse. This was a great Experience and a tuff one. and by the time we got half way across the plains we could drive an ox teame as well as you can Enny day. There was ten persons to Every wagon. There was 6  men in my wagon. three of them left me at Fort Kearney. and two sick in the wagon. and one died on the road. we buried him Nex morning. i had to drive the teame alone all the way to the valleys I had a big red boil under my right arm. which gave me great pain. we had plenty of grass and watter. but verry little wood on the plains. The wemen gathered Buffolose chips to make a fier to cook by. to give us something to eat. we traveled a few days more a got to ash hollow which Which is 150 miles from Fort Kearney. and Fort Kearney is betwen 2 or 3 hundred miles from Missouri River. when we was on the ash hollow hill. the wagon wheel whent over a boy's head, and came very near loseing his life. The Elders administred to him and he got better. his name is Johnathan Prothro. we had to lock both wheels to go down this hill we camped for the night on the botom of the platte river. nex morning we was off again. and after i got out aways from this place. the wagon wheel went over my foot. i took some oil and anointed my foot. and in a short time, it was all right.<p>In Memory of our driveing<p>Indeed we had. a verry tuff times<br>The first few days. we drove our teams<br>The Captain. he would laugh. sometimes<br>at us driveing. yes on the plains,                John<p>In camp after supper. we would sing and chat. at nine oclock we had prayers. then we'd go to rest. There was fifty wagons in the train. we had besids the Captain of the trine. five more were chosen. one for ever ten wagons to tell us what we had to do. one day when traveling on the road. we had a stamped the teams started out on the run and they tangled up fast together. it was a Wonder that no one was kild and nothing brock. Then we parted them and Itch them up again. and traveled a few miles and camped for the night. we had a nother one. but this one was in the night. while they was in the corrall the captain was a fraid of Indians that night. we made a corrall with the Wagons Every Evening. The cattle that night bunted the wagons pretty lively and the captain shouted to the gard to let them go. and they went out on the run. nex morning afater breakfast we got them together some was 15 miles away. We traveled a few miles that day. nex morning we rouled out again. when looking towards the west we could see the Chimney rock. we thought we would get to it that day. but it took us 2 or 3 days. indeed it dose look like a chimney. My wife had a gathered brest. She was sick for a long time. i got the Elders to administered to her and she receved the blessing. and got well. The buffolose on the plains in them days by the tens of thounsands the boys wounded a young bull. and he came a snorting and crossed the road betwen the wagons. but the boys down him and fetched one quarter to camp. now i will write a few words that I read in McCarlton's book, The Wonderland of the wild west. which is verry appropriate rite here. The untraveled tourist will feast his vision on those vast prairis or plains. day after day untill we reach the foot hills of the rocky mountains We passed over these illimitable plains untill the brain reels and the Eye is tired of looking upon the vast Expanse.<p>The Great Plains<p>And what a wonderfull country<br>Is this great western prairie.<br>Where Indians and buffolose romes<br>Without fear. all over the plains.           J.J.D.<p>The night before we came to Lariime. we camped a few miles from the Fort This Fort is located on the south side of the North Platt at the foot of the Black hills. it being 550 miles west of the Missouri River. in the morning we rouled out towards the Fort. and in a short time after we started. we passed a larg camp of Suix Indians. we passed the fort and camped by the platte river for noon. the danish train that was behind us came along the same day the Indians kild one of their cows. The danish captain. tould the millitary captain aboute it. then the captain of the Fort send some of this men to see the Indians aboute it. and they got to a disbuite. and the soldiers fired at them. The Indains kild some of the soldiers and burnt the Fort the danish captain came along to our camp and said. that the Indains was on the war path the trappers also was comeing towards us for dear life. we all crossed the River all right. we had a larg camp. that night. and we thought we would haft to fight. but the Indains had their reveng. we camped together for A few nights. then we sapperated. i beleved that the Lord over ruled it for our good we did not see Enny more Indains untili we came to Salt Lake City<p>The Glorious Plan<p>And when i think. of the gloriouse plan<br>God had reveled. unto fallen man<br>It gives me joy within my mind<br>to think that God. had been so kind<p>2<br>And the gospel. plan. will save the world<br>if they will obey. the laws of God<br>And also them. that's now in prisen<br>for they must here the laws of heaven<p>3<br>our Savior whent there to unlock the door<br>also did preach. to them that was there<br>Joseph and Brigham. and Heber as well<br>They have gon there. the glad tidings to tell<p>4<br>And our ancesters. and friends are there<br>looking to us. their way to prepare<br>Then let us go. and work for the dead<br>This we can do. in the temples of God<p>5<br>And this will be. yes a glorious time<br>When friends and relations. will meet again<br>And when they do meet. how happy they'll be<br>In peace and love. through all Eternity,                          J. J. Davies<p> Now we are in the black hills and in a few days travel. we got to the red bute we jog along again. and got to the willow Spring. and the nex place was the Cayote Spring. and from here to the Independant rock is ten miles. here we struk the Sweet watter. The nex place was the davel's gate. The nex place was the rocky ridge. This ridge his the back bone of the Rocky Mountains. The streams runs from here in all dirictions. here where the South pass is. we are still a going yes up and down through the hills. untill we reach. little Sandy. and nex place was the big Sandy. right here where Lot Smith burnt the wagons with supplies for that great American army. lead by General Johnson. They was sent by the goverment. to punish the latter day Saints. for something that was not true. Six miles further west we struk the green river. The nex place we come to was Fort Bridger. and in this old Fort that Army spent the winter of 1857. And they stayed there becaus they was oblidged too. The distants from this Fort to Salt Lake City. is one hundred and 13 miles. we bid good by to the Fort. and traveled along the best we could. untill we got through the Emmegration Canyon. then we could see the valles of the mountains. which made us to rejoice and to thank the Lord for his blessing to us on the journny. we got to the city of the saints a few days after the october conference of 1854. we rould through the city with joyfull hearts and camped on the Emmegration square west of the temple block. we all felt to rejoice can you blame us for haveing a joyfull hearts. No. i do not think that you would. i know if you had to travel such a journny you would feel to rejoice and to thank the Lord. for the blessings that you did receve on such journey. for i can say that the Lord. did bless us on that great journny.<p>In Memory of the Journny<p>And when we left. our Native land<br>to go west. to the promise land<br>We felt so bad. to leve behind<br>the dearest friends. that was so kind.<p>2<br>I know that we. was glad to see<br>The watters. of the inland sea<br>And the great city. of the west<br>where the pilgrims shall have a rest.       John J. Davies.<p>My wife's cusen Elizabeth and her husband Rees J. Williams came to see us in camp and we had a good chat together. he said to us. i want you to come and stay awhile with us. we stayed with them untill Christmas time was over after i rested a few days i started to work on the new road from the City West to the jordan bridge. after this job was done i worked on the public works. I help to bild the Endowment house and also on the foundation of that great temple and when i was working here i had a terable blow. one of the larg blocks of rock slipt down to the foundation and struck one of the levers and it came in such a force and struck me on the side of my head senceless to the ground. the brethren adminstered to me and i got better. The superintendent of the work was Brother Daniel H. Wells. Now i will say a word aboute the fight. it was in the winter of 1854 on Christmas morning between the mormon boys and collonel Steptoa's soldiers. I was rite there at the time. it was geting quite ruff before they quit. President Young sent Brother Orsen Hide to stop it and it was lucky that it was stopt becaus it was getting quite ruff. the boys done as they was tould and peace was restored. the work on the public works stopt at Christmas time. Then i work at my trade to Sister McKeny in the Elaventh ward i work for her untili April Conference in 1855 Sister McKeny and my self and wife whent to meeting held in the Tabenacle on Sunday in a carage. This was a great honor to us. i wove that winter five hundred yards of carpet for the use of the Tabernacle and after the April Conference was over i went to North Ogden to live. The first Sunday I was here the Bishop, Brother Thomas Dun, set me apart to lead the singing and to organized a singing class. So I did. and before i left North Ogden we had a good choir. now I will say a few words aboute the grass hoper war. They distroyed Nearly all the crops in the Northern Settlements and bread stuff wa verry sceres many had to dig roots to sustain life. i had to do that myself. i went to the field to Watter my corn one day i got verry week and started for home and when i got to the door of the house i met my little daughter Martha and she ask for some bread and butter, and there was no bread in the house. This was a trying time, you bet. i took a sack and started out and said, i will have some flower before i'll come back. i went to mother Marler. all she had in the house was twenty pounds of flower and one lofe of bread. She gave me half of what she had in the house and when i got home my wife smiled. Then we had a good breakfast. I wove one hundred yards of colth to her son in law Brother Baily Lake. he paid me flower. Then I had flower to do me untill fall. he was kild by the Indians on his way home from his Salmon river Mission. This was in the Spring of 1858.<br>When i started to America in the year 1854, i left my Mother in Wales. and in the month of october 1856, two years after I left Wales my mother died This my friends, was indeed sorrowful news to me<p>A few lines to her Memory<p>It was a task to me that day<br>to give my Mother the last good by<br>She reached her hand and i did mine<br>oh what a feeling i had that time,      her son John<p>Now i will say a word or two aboute that great feest we had after the faming. it was on the 24. of July 1856. we had bread made from the wheat that growed this year. and we had all kind of vagetable that growed this year. and i can say my friends that this was a feast in reality. and we Enjoyed our selves well. and a more jovial croud you never seen. The winter of 1856 X 57 was Exceedingly sever in Utah. Snow fell to the depth of Eight feet at various places in the valleys. and i will never forget that winter. The snow was 6 feet deep in North Ogden.<br>The great move to the South from the North. In the beginning of 1857. Judge W. W. drummond haveing returned to the state raised a great Excitement by Representing that the people of utah were in open Rebellion againts the Government. and on the 24. of July, Brother J. L. Stoddard arrived from Independence Missouri without the mail for utah. he also brought the news that General Harney with a force of two or three thounsand soldiers was sent to utah to supres the mormons. as the army approached, aboute 1,500 of the territorial militia were sent to chet their progress on the road. and some successful raids were made. on teams and cattle herds without sheding of blood. and the army concluded to winter at Fort Bidger 115 miles from Salt Lake City<p>The Truth<p>Awake ye Nations of the Earth<br>And listen to the words of truth<br>The time will come when you will say<br>The men of God have gon away<p>2<br>I know that time will surely come<br>When God will call the Elders home<br>The people then will morn and say<br>Why dident God servents with us stay<p>3<br>Because you did not listen too<br>Those Elders that was sent to you<br>for they did preach the plan that's given<br>by the great God that dwels in heaven<p>4<br>These Elders was dispized by men<br>When preaching words of truth to them<br>And now a change had come at last<br>For prejudice is dying fast.                      J. J. Davies<p>Early in the spring of 1858 president young tould the latter day Saints that salvation of the Saints was in moveing south and towards the Latter part of march, the people began to Evacuate Slat Lak City, and the Entire country North of utah valley. President Buchanan sent peace commissioners. They and the leaders of the Saints arrived to a peaceable treaty and the army Entered Slat Lake City. They remained at Camp Floyd untill the autumn of 1861. when it returned to take part in the contest betwen the North and South, Camp Floyd was broken up. instead of a cures to the people the army was a great blessing. to us in supplying many of their necesitise at a verry low rate. The prophet of God said that the Lord Excepted the sacrifice of the people and he said that the Lord would bless them for it. and I can bear my testimony that the Lord did bless us just as he said I never forget seeing women and children as well as men who were destitute of teams pulling handcarts through the storm of snow. indeed it was a sublime Exhibition. of faith of the latter day Saints. and when traveling south the time of the move the people had teams and wagons of all disgription the best team to my fancy. was three yoks of yearling. indeed they did look prety. I whent as far as Spanish Fork and stayed here one year. and went back to my home in the North in the fall of 1859. we as a people was blessed after the move, allthough it was a great sacrifice for us<p>Their Just Due<p>Some people they think they know it all<br>And others, they'll say knows nothing atall<br>But this is not right for me and for you<br>Then let us givee all what is their just due.<p>2<br>And here i will say to you and to me<br>yes. let us be kind to all that we see<br>And also be true. and do what is best<br>When we'll be happy and we shall be blest.                  The old man Davies<p>I bought a city lot in Spanish fork when i was there the time of the move, and made quite a sum of money off my garden truck that summer. sould to the pedlers. They took them to Camp Floyd. i worked in this camp in the fall. i did not have a team of my own the time of the move. i bought a yok of cattle And a wagon. and started back to my old home in the North in the fall of 1859. and in the year of 1864. i left North ogden to go to Kanarra Iron County we started on the 5. of November. we got to Salt Lake City. and while we was here we had a snow strom. we whent from here to Leigh and stayed with my Uncle Thomas.
