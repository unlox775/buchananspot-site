She was of German extraction as her maiden name indicates, and was married to John Buchanan 1812 emigrated in 1830 to Illinois, where she first heard the Gospel. She was baptized in the winter of 1835 and in 1837 she joined the Saints in Caldwell Co., Missouri, where she passed through the privations and hardships of the Saints there. In the winter of 1837-38 she was expelled from the state and returned to Quincy, Ill. and from thence to Lima, and that state, where through disease brought on by exposure and hardship endured in Missouri, her husband died in 1839, leaving her with a family of eight children to provide for, In 1844 she was driven by mob violence from Lima to Nauvoo, where she remained until the Spring of 1846, when she, with a large company of Saints took up the line of march to the great west. At Winter Quarters her son John, her only help, enlisted in the Mormon Battalions and at the expiration of his term he returned to Winter Quarters, made arrangements and started with his mother and the younger children across the plains. They reached Salt Lake Valley in 1853 (1852) and continued their journey to Sanpete Valley the same seasons where they have continued to reside. Sister Buchanan knew but little of the pleasures of this life until her arrival here. Since that time, however she has enjoyed peace and happiness in her sons' households where all that loving hearts and willing hands could do to render her comfortable and happy was done. She retained her mental powers to the last moments and was an untiring and uncompromising Latter-day Saint. In all her persecutions and trials she never faltered nor wavered for a moment, but died as she had lived -- full of love for the gospel, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
