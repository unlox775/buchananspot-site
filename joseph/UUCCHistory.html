The primary users of the Computer Center services were the Electrical Engineering department and others of the College of Engineering. Over the years, as computing and technology needs were identified, the Computer Center worked to fulfill those needs.<br>The following was written in November 1970 as a description of UUCC:<pre>THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH COMPUTER CENTER    The University of Utah Computer Center was established in1959 to provide computer services to the growing universitycommunity for its complex and diverse needs. Currently the Centeralso provides its computing services to several off-campusbusiness groups as well as other schools and universities. Thereare several smaller computers on campus, some of which areconnected to the facility at the Computer Center. Although eachof these is a physically separate facility, much of theUniversity's expertise is consolidated at the Center for thebenefit of the entire campus.    The hardware at the Computer Center consists of a Univac1108, nine tape drives, six high speed drums, two large massstorage devices whose capacity is 262 million characters, severalprinters, card readers, miscellaneous unit record devices andcommunications equipment. In addition the Center has an opticalscanner used for test scoring, a digitizer and a high precision 48x 60 inch flat bed plotter which can also be used for cuttingmylar.    The Center maintains a library of many programs developed byits staff as well as several application and statistic programssuch as APT, GPSS, PERT, Linear programming and the BMD programs.Extended Fortran, Cobol, Algol, Basic and Assembler comprise someof the languages available to the programmers.    Assistance in numeric analysis, statistical design, businesssystems analysis and special programming requirements can beobtained from members of the technical staff at the Center. Onweek-days there is available at no charge a consulting serviceintended to minimize difficulty in using computer facilities.These consultants are qualified to answer questions regarding jobset up, file maintenance, diagnostic messages, control statementsand use of library programs.    The Computer Center is located on the north side of thecampus in the Merrill Engineering Building and is open twenty-fourhours a day seven days a week.</pre>From the beginning and for quite a while, the Computer Center was self-sufficient financially. It worked within a system for cost recovery where services were paid for by the recipients and eventually some basic services were provided for campus at little or no cost, while other services were charged for at a rate to underwrite the campus services. Later, in the 1980's, the University provided a budget for the Computer Center and charging for services to the campus users gradually diminished and service to off-campus customers were for the most part discontinued. The major change came in 1988 when the Sperry Univac mainframe computer was disconnected and removed from the Computer Center.<p> Following are some pictures of people associated with or links to articles about the Computer Center over the years, generally in chronological order.<hr><a href="UUCCParties.html">UUCC parties and events over the years.</a><hr><img ALIGN=top width=246 height=159 src="images/Resch.jpg"ALT = "Resch on plotter"><br>Professor Ron Resch (of Computer Science) cutting the aluminum pieces for the Ukrainian Egg he designed for the <a href="http://www.cuug.ab.ca/VT/vegreville.html">Vegreville</a>, Canada Chamber of Commerce (around 1974) on our old Gerber plotter.<hr> -- <a href="UUCC_Library_1974.html">About computer training in connection with the Marriott Library (1974)</a>.<hr> -- <a href="UUCC_RTB_1974.html">About Instruction and Research Computing - with RTB (1974)</a>.<hr><br><img ALIGN=top width=264 height=111 src="images/Mark&LeRoy.jpg"ALT = "Mark and LeRoy"><br>Mark Thomson (left) and LeRoy Eide (right) in systems support (1975).<br><img ALIGN=top width=257 height=182 src="images/JBuchanan1975.jpg"ALT = "Joseph Buchanan in 1975"><br>Joseph Buchanan at a Tektronix Terminal (1975).<br><img ALIGN=top width=171 height=142 src="images/RSwalberg.jpg"ALT = "Randy Swalberg"><br>Randy Swalberg (1975).<br><img ALIGN=top width=173 height=112 src="images/VAlder.jpg"ALT = "Val Alder"><br>Val Alder Stuff in the Keypunch Room (1975).<br><img ALIGN=top width=171 height=267 src="images/JSchlight.jpg"ALT = "Jim Schlight"><br>Jim Schlight in the Machine Room (1975).<hr> -- <a href="UUCC_Mac_1984.html">About the Apple Macintosh agreement with the University of Utah (1984)</a>.<br><img ALIGN=top width=356 height=224 src="images/StaffInClass2.jpg"ALT = "Some UUCC Staff in MacLab"><br>Some UUCC Staff in MacLab: (l to r) Steve Fullerton, Chuck Evans, Elham Ghalambor and Byron Davis (1984).<br><img ALIGN=top width=342 height=234 src="images/MacLab1984.jpeg"><br>The Macintosh teaching lab (MacLab) in 1984.
