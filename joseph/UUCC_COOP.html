The lockon that door has been changed to match the lock to the I/0 Roomand Machine Room. This should permit greater access to the CO-OP.We therefore invite all Computer Center employees to participatein the CO-OP.You should be informed that we are now keeping much closer trackof our operation, and in the few days since we have been keepingtrack, we have noticed some loss. Despite the 25 cent price wecharge, we have been taking in approximately 19 cents per bottlesold. SOMEONE IS RIPPING US OFF! We admit freely that we areselling somewhat over our cost, and some people may well resentthis. Please be aware, however, that we originally put up some$55.00 out of our own pockets to get the operation started in thefirst place. Any actual profit that we make, after replacing lostor broken bottles, etc., will be returned to you, the participantsin the CO-OP in the form of a party, or low-cost snacks (lowerthan the vending machines at any rate).The CO-OP exists for the mutual benefit of all of the ComputerCenter employees, as an alternative to the high-cost andunreliability of the machines in the Loud Room downstairs. It isessential that we have your cooperation and honest behavior inorder to keep the operation afloat.Procedurally, the CO-OP will now work as follows:(1)   All drinks are 25 cents. We no longer will require a bottle      deposit(2)	Since we cannot afford to hire a full time bookkeeper,    	we cannot sell drinks on credit. This means no IOUs.(3)	It is no longer necessary to replace cold drinks with warm     ones. We will do this each evening. This will allow us to     better keep track of which drinks are selling best, and thus     better control our stock.(4)	We do not appreciate the odd numbers of pennies that have     been showing up in the cash bins. Although at least one     person who admits doing this claims to be putting in pennies     over and above the 25 cents, we still are befuddled when our     daily balance does not come out in a multiple of 25 cents,     particularly when that balance is less than it should be for     the number of bottles sold that day.We welcome comments and criticisms from you and will do our bestto respond to your needs and desires.<pre></body></html>
