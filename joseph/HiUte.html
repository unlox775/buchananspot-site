I loved the place. In one of my recent visits to the area, I dispaired at the massive and ugly development that is going on there and I wrote this verse. The pictures above were taken recently, and in them I was able to find some shots that excluded the development. The whole area, including the <a href="images/HiUteRanch/SnydervBasin1.jpeg">Snyderville Basin</a> has been highly developed.</p><hr><p><img border="1" width="303" height="451" ALIGN=left src="http://www.cc.utah.edu/~joseph/images/HiUteRanch/HiUteWinter.jpg"ALT = "Hi Ute Ranch, Winter 1958">The picture to the left is one of the only ones I have from that time, showing the row of pine trees leading up to the house we first lived in. I also wrote a <a href="DennyLetter.html">letter to a friend</a> describing the place (though I did not mail it).</p>The area where we lived was also called Gorgoza. Our phone number there was 595R2. A history of the start of Gorgoza can be found as part of <a href="http://www.uen.org/cgi-bin/websql/ucme/aboutus.hts">The Utah Collections Multimedia Encyclopedia</a>. The excerpt about Gorgoza follows:</p><p>GORGOZA* (Summit County) is two and one-half miles east of Parleys Summit. The area was originally settled in 1889 and named for Rodriquez Velasquez de la Gorgozada, a Spaniard who invested almost a million dollars in a narrow-gauge railroad. This railroad was supposed to be built as an extension from Park City* to Salt Lake City*. A representative for Brigham Young traveled to France to solicit the help of the Spaniard, who was promised that a city would be built and named in his honor. The project did not fulfill its planned destiny.</p><p>S11,T15S,R3E,SLM; 6,350' (1,935m).</p><p>Bibliography:<br>Writers' Program. Origins of Utah Place Names. 3d ed.
