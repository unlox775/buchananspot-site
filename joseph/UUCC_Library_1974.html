The Computer Center, with the help of the Audio Visual Department and Instructional Television, have made available two courses designed to help students and faculty who wish to learn about computers and how to use them.<p>One of the courses introduces SPSS ( Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ). This course consists of two one-half hour, color video tapes which may be played back on the TV playback units in the Audio Visual Department at the library. The tapes were developed by the University of Kentucky and are excellent. Anyone wishing a good introduction to SPSS should plan on seeing these tapes. SPSS is a statistical package designed for those not trained in computer programming and makes the speed and power of the computer available to anyone needing to do statistical research.<p>The other course teaches the BASIC programming language. It consists of seven 30-minute slide/ tape recorder lessons. Subject matter ranges from flow charting to analysis and construction of simulation programs. The lesson titles are:<p><ol><li>The Lady Cataswank Case<li> The Elephant Numbers Case<li>The Sinfoo Atrocity Case<li>The 8 Chests of Gold Case<li> The Rugby Cup Games Case<li> The Tainted Tea Case<li>The Picadilly Fund Case</ol>These lessons were developed by Control Data Corporation and do a great job of teaching BASIC. Persons wishing to use the new low-cost RTB ( Real Time BASIC ) time-sharing computer system should see these lessons.<p>All of the above lessons may be viewed at the Audio Visual Department of the Marriott Library.<p>-- Merriel Dewsnup<br></body></html>
